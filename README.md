Hotel Management Network System Using Cisco

Here I have build a network system for a hotel. This network contains several levels and departments with some devices. I tried to make the network to connect all devices from any point of the network.
In this network we have both wired and wireless devices, I connected the users devices whose are wireless such as mobile, tab into this network. 
This network is very user friendly, and easy to access along with strong security. 
And I have implemented this network in the Cisco packet tracer software.
